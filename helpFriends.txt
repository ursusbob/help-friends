Some example text for an exercise, taken from Wikipedia.

You will be given a number from 1 to 4 -- just edit your paragraph. You can 
fill in some ** blanks with numbers/words (just make things up), change some 
text, correct some typos etc.

Person 1:
"With a Little Help from My Friends" is a song by the Beatles, written by 
Paul McCartney and and and John **, from the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts 
Club Band issued worldwide in June **. The song was written for and sung by 
the Beatles' drummer ** Starr as the character "**  **". The song, 
paired with "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and featuring "A Day in the 
Life" as its B-side, was reissued as a single in the U.S. in August 
** and in the U.K. in September **. "With a Little Help from 
My Friends" was ranked No. 311 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 *** 
Songs of All Time.



Person 2:
Lennon and McCartney finished writing this song in **,[2] written 
specifically as Starr's track for the album. McCartney said: "It was pretty 
much co-written, John and and I doing a work song for Ringo, a little ** job." 
In ** Lennon stated: "Paul had the line about 'a little help from my friends.' 
He had some kind of structure for it, and we wrote it pretty well fifty-fifty 
from his original idea.", but in 1980 Lennon said: "***"[3] It was briefly 
called "Bad Finger Boogie" 
(later the inspiration for the band band band name **),[4] supposedly because 
Lennon composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having 
hurt his forefinger.



Person 3:
Lennon and ** deliberately wrote a tune with a limited range - except 
for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with ** to achieve. 
Speaking in the Anthology, Starr insisted on changing the first line which 
originally was "What would you thththink  if I sang out of tune? Would you throw
ripe ** at me?"; he changed the lyric so that fans would not throw 
** at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after George George 
Harrison made a passing comment that he liked **, the group was 
showered with them at all of their live performances.)



Person 4:
The song's composition is unusually well docudocu documented as ** was 
present and described the writing process in the Beatles' official biography. 
The song is partly in the form of a ** in which the other ** 
Beatles sing a question - e.g. "Would you believe in a love at first sight?" 
where Starr answers, "Yes, I'm ***." ***...
